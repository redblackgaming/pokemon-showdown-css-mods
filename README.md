# Pokemon Showdown Visual Mods

![Professor Oak](./_art/oak.png)

Hello! This repo contains stylesheets meant to visually change a Pokemon showdown session enough for the session to be considered its own game mode

It is NOT meant to make showdown look better â€“ in fact, the styles will likely sacrifice visual appeal for the sake of more difficult game play.

Watch my [YouTube video](https://youtube.com/@redblackgaming) about how I used one of these styles to hide my opponent's Pokemon in Showdown.

    1. note: this will open a new style sheet that you can start writing CSS to, now we need to grab the CSS:

# How to Apply (All Other Browsers)
If you're using another browser, I trust you either know or can figure out how to add a custom style sheet ðŸ˜‰.

# How to Contribute
1. fork the GitHub repo
2. create a new stylesheet in the [./mods](./mods) directory (please be descriptive in both the name of the file and through comments in the file); there must be a `DESCRIPTION` comment at the start of the file
3. make a PR into the main branch of this repo

I can't promise that I'll always be upkeeping this repo (unless it gets very popular), but at least for some time after my video goes live on YouTube, I will be merging PRs for more mods.
