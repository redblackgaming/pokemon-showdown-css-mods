# Pokemon Showdown Visual Mods

![Professor Oak](./_art/oak.png)

Hello! This repo contains stylesheets meant to visually change a Pokemon showdown session enough for the session to be considered its own game mode

It is NOT meant to make showdown look better â€“ in fact, the styles will likely sacrifice visual appeal for the sake of more difficult game play.

Watch my [YouTube video](https://youtube.com/@redblackgaming) about how I used one of these styles to hide my opponent's Pokemon in Showdown.

# How to Apply Styles
1. navigate to the [./mods](https://github.com/redblackgaming/pokemon-showdown-css-mods/mods) directory and locate the file you'd like to use, based on its name (or description inside the file)

2. copy the entire contents of the file:



# How to Contribute
1. fork the GitHub repo
2. create a new stylesheet in the [./mods](https://github.com/redblackgaming/pokemon-showdown-css-mods/mods) directory (please be descriptive in both the name of the file and through comments in the file); there must be a `DESCRIPTION` comment at the start of the file
3. make a PR into the main branch of this repo

I can't promise that I'll always be upkeeping this repo (unless it gets very popular), but at least for some time after my video goes live on YouTube, I will be merging PRs for more mods.
